What were the benefits of using a context free grammar for your task domain?
- Using a context free grammar with this allowed me to create a scenario that felt more "open" and like there
    was a sense of choice and variability, while still giving me a pattern to easily grade and intervene for all mistakes.


What were the down sides or difficulties of using a context free grammar for your task domain?
-  Because we have to provide words for the learner to choose from, I had difficulties in chooseing or evaluating which words would challenge
    the learner to think about the solution instead of just building an answer using context clues. Are my words vague enough to not give the 
    answer away yet specific enough for them to build a meaningful answer?


What were the benefits of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?
- It was easy to evaulate what was right and what was wrong and I defined what the specific wrong answers were. It made the grading structure
    simple and easy to implement.


What were the down sides or difficulties of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?
-  I had issues structuring which "wrong" answer was higher priority than another. If the students answer contained mulltiple wrong components
    then I had to decide a heirarchy of things to give feedback on. Like if they had "kick the kitten in the eyes" I had to decide if the action
    was more important to note first or if the fact that they were aiming for the eyes was more important. I can see this issue getting more complicated
    with more complicated questions that have multiple wrong ways to answer.
